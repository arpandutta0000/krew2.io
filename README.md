# krew2

# Misc.

This is the repository for a cleanup of Krew.io.

**Running in development** (using grunt-nodemon as a watchscript)
``npm run dev``

**Running in production** (using pm2 to keep process alive)

Running in dev mode serves to ``localhost:8080``.

In production, Nginx proxies the local webfront port to 443 and redirects 80 to 443.
